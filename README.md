QuickSwitch is a Magisk/KernelSU/Apatch module which systemlessly allows supported launchers to access the recents (QuickStep) APIs

## Donations:

- If you wish to donate to [Paphonb](https://github.com/paphonb) for creating the QuickSwitch app you can do so [here](https://paypal.me/Paphonb).
- Or if you wish to sponsor [Skittles9823](https://github.com/skittles9823) on GitHub for making the module, scripts, and handling support you can do so [here](https://github.com/sponsors/skittles9823).

## Notes:

- QuickSwitch doesn't add support for launchers, launchers need to support QuickSwitch. Because of this, a full list of compatible launchers will not be provided as the app autodetects which launchers are compatible.
- Nova will likely never support QuickSwitch unless they decide to add support for the Razer Phone natively.

## Requirements:

- Latest version of Magisk or KernelSU or Apatch
- Android 9+

## Installation:

## Magisk:

1. Install the latest QuickSwitch zip from the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/QuickstepSwitcherReleases) or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/skittles9823/QuickSwitch/releases).
2. Open the QuickSwitch app that was installed.
3. Select a different launcher as your recents provider.
4. Reboot.
5. Verify your new recents provider is correct.
6. Set the new recents provider as the default launcher.
7. Profit.

## KSU/APatch:

1. Install the latest QuickSwitch zip from the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/QuickstepSwitcherReleases) or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/skittles9823/QuickSwitch/releases).
2. Open a terminal app and `su`
3. run `/data/adb/modules/quickswitch/quickswitch --ch=launcher.package.name`
4. Reboot.
5. Verify your new recents provider is correct.
6. Set the new recents provider as the default launcher.
7. Profit.

## Debugging:

- The app will save logs to /sdcard/Documents/quickswitch whenever it attempts to switch providers
- All logs begin with **quickswitch**
- If you have any issues, please join the [Telegram group](https://t.me/QuickstepSwitcherSupport) and send the logs along with what your issue is.
